<br>
<br>
I'm Paolo Veneziani and I'm a Junior *Angular* developer.
<br>
<br>
I've attended a six months course with Develhope and learned to use the Angular framework. 
<br>
<br>
I have previous knowledge of C and C++,  but in this course I have learned to use, in addition to HTML and CSS, *Javascript* and *Typescript*.
<br>
<br>
Among my *public repos* it is possible to find some works I have collaborated on, including a Single Page Application which takes input data from a Form and shows them in an organized and captivating way. There's also a clone of the Apple *Mac* page.</div>
